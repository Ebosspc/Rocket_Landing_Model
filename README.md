  For most of the history of rocketry, after a rocket has burnt through all of the fuel in its tanks, the section, or stage of the rocket, containing the fuel tanks separates from the rest of the rocket and falls back to Earth. As it enters the atmosphere, the friction it creates with the standing air generates high amounts of heat, burning up the falling portion of the rocket in the atmosphere before it even reaches the ground. This process leaves behind only the payload of the rocket in orbit, or anywhere else in space it needs to be and completely destroys the rest of the rocket. Looking at this process from an economic standpoint, it is very efficient and wasteful. 

  Every single time someone wants to send a small payload into orbit they have to spend millions of dollars for an entirely new rocket. Most significantly, it forces people to waste tons of money remaking complex rocket engines. One solution to this economic disaster in the rocket industry is having the rockets land themselves so they don’t burn up, can be reused for further missions, and make rocketry more economical because someone won’t have to pay for an entirely new chassis and engines.
  
  This paper will explore the possibilities of rocket landings and attempt to model a rocket landing to better understand how a rocket can behave in the atmosphere in order to successfully land.
